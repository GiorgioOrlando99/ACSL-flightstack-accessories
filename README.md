# ACSL-flightstack-accessories

This repository provides accessory files to help process and visualize log file data generated by the [**ACSL-flightstack**](https://github.com/andrealaffly/ACSL-flightstack).

## Repository Content

### 1. _LOGS_PLOTTER
This folder contains MATLAB scripts for importing and plotting log data.

- **`createWorkspace.m`**  
  This script imports log files and creates a workspace in the MATLAB environment for processing. It serves as the entry point for working with flight data logs.

- **`PLOTTER_PID.m`**  
  A sample script that provides an example of plotting PID controller-related log data stored in the MATLAB workspace, using the workspace created by `createWorkspace.m`.

- **`PLOTTER_MRAC.m`**  
  A sample script that shows how to plot log data related to Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) experiments, using the workspace created by `createWorkspace.m`.

### 2. Sample_Flight_Data
This folder contains example log files from flight tests. These files can be imported into MATLAB using the scripts in the `_LOGS_PLOTTER` folder for visualization and analysis.
